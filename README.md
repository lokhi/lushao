# Lushao

A tiny ruby wrapper around Lusha API. The Lusha API enables you to enrich and authenticate the business profiles you utilize and offer.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lushao'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lushao

## Usage

```ruby
require 'lushao'
lushao = Lushao.new('Your secret API key')

```
Your secret API key. You can get it in your dashboard from https://dashboard.lusha.co/api

## Person API
The person API lets you look up a person data based on his name and the company, or the domain of the company he works for. For example, you can get the personâ€™s location, email and phone number, as well as his or her social network username.

### With company name
```ruby
result = lushao.find_person_with_company("intercom","Rob","Taylor")
```
### With company domain
```ruby
result = lushao.find_person_with_domain("intercom.com","Rob","Taylor")
```

### Accessing person response
```ruby
result.data.fetch(:phoneNumbers)
result.data.fetch(:emailAddresses)
```


## Company API
The company API provides information about any organization you look for to help you get a complete picture, such as overview, social network presence and location.

### With company name
```ruby
result = lushao.find_company_with_name("intercom")
```
### With company domain
```ruby
result = lushao.find_company_with_domain("intercom.com")
```

### Accessing company response
```ruby
result.data.fetch(:description)
result.data.fetch(:domain)
result.data.fetch(:employees)
result.data.fetch(:founded)
result.data.fetch(:founders)
result.data.fetch(:logo)
result.data.fetch(:name)
result.data.fetch(:social)
result.data.fetch(:website)
```

## Check for errors
```ruby
if  defined?(result.errors)
  puts result.errors[:message]
else
    # Accessing response and do some stuff
end
```
